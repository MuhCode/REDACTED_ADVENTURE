Welcome to the [REDACTED] adventure game, this is a basic adventure game I made for my Comp Programming 1 class and is
a pretty ambitious project since I have never done something of this scope before, it turned out well but notably left
out a couple of features that I would have loved to include, this is a good working point however for many things such
as adding battles and possibly a whole new level if I decided too. Please if playing make sure you have the reqs and
read the tutorial as the game and actions aren't too clear and the tutorial is only a short block of text, this game is
meant to be played at least 2-3 times and you might die a couple times, embrace death and take in the descriptions as you
work to escape the mysterious place you are dropped into! To play just run the main.py file and enjoy!!! If you have any
cool ideas credit my work and improve it to your liking as well as feeling free to email me or comment with improvements.
Again, this is a beginner project and very much looks like it when analyzing the code, it is mostly clear but I know it
could be more efficient if I started with a better plan, but again just play and enjoy. Make sure to run the exe and let
me know if it runs well or not! I'll be sure to expand and change up the project as my passion is making video games and 
this is only the start of that journey haha!
